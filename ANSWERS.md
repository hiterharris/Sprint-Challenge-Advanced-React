- [ ] Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)?
    - [ ] Class components allow you to set and update state in a component and pass it to its children components.

- [ ] Name three lifecycle methods and their purposes.
    - [ ] componentDidMount: runs at the end of the mounting phase; it can fetch data, set up event listeners, etc.
    componentDidUpdate: runs after component updates with new state
    componentWillUnmount: removes/destroys event listeners, subscriptions, or timers

- [ ] What is the purpose of a custom hook?
    Custom hooks groups stateful logic into one hook outside of the component that can be imported to make it more reusable

- [ ] Why is it important to test our apps?
    Testing out apps helps find bugs, allows us to trust our code, safety net when refactoring, encourages us to write more testable (better) code
